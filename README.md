//Karchain is a platform to decentralize automotive financial servicing and processing of payments [car loans, car insurance & car maintenance] including the payment structure by removing the need to store currency at a bank and store both crypto/ fiat currency in a smart contract & smart title private ledger.  What blockchain is to currencies, karchain is to automobiles...

//Karchain is our version of Blockchain but designed for Cars and Trucks, and soon for Motorcycles, RVs and ATVs in 2019.  We use Karchain as a way to help anyone in any part of the world - to get a car loan, car insurance and car maintenance without having borders. Where a smart financial company that can give you a car loan, car insurance and car maintenance plan all under one roof, anywhere in the world.

//KarTokens are also a new and simple way to pay, transact and record services rendered to your car, i.e.: you purchased an oil change and used KarTokens to make that purchase.  Now that purchase is recorded and a history is created for the oil change performed to the car.  Anyone who purchases that car, 1- can see when the oil change was done, 2- who performed the oil change and 3- when the next oil change is due. It's not only oil changes, it's anything that's car related, even tires, brakes, even engine services or autobody services and more!!

//KarTokens can also be used for in-car purchases, drive-thru's, in-car entertainment, etc.. we developed unlimited use cases in using KarTokens thats auto related. KarTokens is a simple way to purchase a automobile or services/products without borders, we use KarTokens to make those purchases virtual online through smart phone/tablet app or desktop vpn portal or either in a "plastic credit card" form of payment.

//Smart Contract allows members [private] /consumers [public] to purchase products or services privately without fully disclosing themselves to the public. It's a safe way to make these types of purchases without disclosing all of the personal details of the transaction in owning an automobile or making purchases with KarTokens.

//Smart Contract can:
1- give the ability to pay for services rendered at any point in time [time triggered]
2- add interest to any amount [crypto/fiat currency] stored in the smart contract [value-add services]
3- track data or assets stored in the smart contract [smart assets]
4- transfer or resolve smart contracts using AI input [smart legal eagle]

//Smart Title Ledger allows members [private] /consumers [public] allows OCP Bank, to create value in owning an automobile by removing the need to hold vehicle titles. And placing the vehicle title in the control of the vehicle owner in developing a smart financial service the owner can afford in owning that vehicle.

//Smart Title Ledgers can Read/Write/Record/Trace/Define:
1- the ability for consumers to control there vehicle title [time controlled asset]
2- AI driven payment services, consumers make smart financial choices in owning any vehicle in any crypto/flat currency [smart payments] 
3- no more legal problems in ownership [proof of work vs proof of ownership]
4- AI output from the smart title ledger [smart accountability]
